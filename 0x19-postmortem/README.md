### Issue Summary: The Great "Server Hide-and-Seek" Incident
**Duration:**  
The hide-and-seek game lasted for **2 hours and 37 minutes** from **10:13 AM to 12:50 PM UTC** on **August 18, 2024**.

**Impact:**  
During this thrilling game, **75%** of our users were left out in the cold, unable to access our web app because our API decided to play hard-to-get. Users in Europe and North America got an all-expenses-paid trip to "500 Internal Server Error" land—something they didn’t sign up for!

**Root Cause:**  
It turns out that our Nginx load balancer got a little too excited and routed traffic to a retired backend server that was chilling out after being decommissioned last week. Unfortunately, this server was not in the mood to work and refused to play along, resulting in widespread service disruption.

### Timeline: How the Game Unfolded
- **10:13 AM UTC:** Our monitoring system sent out a frantic "SOS" signal, alerting us to a surge in "500 Internal Server Errors."
- **10:15 AM UTC:** The on-call engineer grabbed their detective hat and dove into the API server logs, searching for clues.
- **10:25 AM UTC:** Suspecting the new code deployment as the culprit, they hit the "rollback" button like a boss—but the errors laughed in their face.
- **10:35 AM UTC:** With the usual suspects cleared, it was time to poke around the network logs and load balancer configurations.  
- **10:50 AM UTC:** The mystery deepened, so the case was escalated to the Network Engineering team—the true Sherlock Holmes of our tech world.
- **11:15 AM UTC:** A wild goose chase led us down a path of database checks, but that road was a dead end.
- **11:45 AM UTC:** Finally, someone noticed that the load balancer was pointing to an old, grumpy server that had retired last week—oops!
- **12:00 PM UTC:** We fixed the load balancer configuration, but the cache took its sweet time, delaying the resolution.
- **12:50 PM UTC:** The cache finally got the memo, and services were restored to all users. Game over.

### Root Cause and Resolution: The Mystery Solved
**Root Cause:**  
Our load balancer went rogue, sending traffic to a retired backend server that had been peacefully sipping margaritas ever since its decommissioning. The misconfiguration happened during a routine maintenance update when an old Nginx config file was mistakenly pushed to production.

**Resolution:**  
After realizing the mix-up, we updated the Nginx configuration to route traffic to the correct, hard-working servers. We tested the new setup in staging (no margaritas here) before deploying it to production. Cache propagation took a bit longer than expected, but eventually, all users were back in action.

### The "We Won't Let This Happen Again" Plan
**Improvements:**
1. **Keep Your Configs in Check:** Implement stricter version control for configuration files with automated sanity checks to prevent retired servers from sneaking back into the game.
2. **Smart Monitoring:** Upgrade our monitoring system to catch misrouted traffic faster, so we can squash issues before they become widespread.
3. **Fast-Track Rollbacks:** Develop automated rollback mechanisms that can save the day without breaking a sweat.

**Task List:**
- **Automated Nginx Configuration Validation:** Add a script to check for outdated or misrouted server entries before deploying any configuration.
- **Enhanced Monitoring Probes:** Deploy new monitoring tools to test API health from multiple backend servers, ensuring no more retiree servers get involved.
- **Mirror, Mirror on the Wall:** Improve our staging environment to more closely reflect production, so we catch sneaky issues before they hit users.
- **Document the Battle Plan:** Revamp our configuration management process documentation to ensure clarity and prevent future slip-ups.
- **Training Day:** Hold a training session for the team to reinforce best practices in configuration management and incident response.
